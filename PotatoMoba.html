                    <h3>Innate Attribute: Immortality</h3>
                    <p>Potato and his summonable friends are immortal and cannot be slain. Upon reaching 1 HP, Potato teleports back to his base and enters a stasis for the same duration it would take for a hero of his level to respawn. This is known as "recovery" rather than "respawn."</p>
                    <p>Potato may break out of stasis early, but his attributes and stats will be prorated to the percentage of the stasis duration completed. Resuming stasis is slower than entering upon reaching 1 HP, recovering Potato's stats at half the normal rate. Potato may only break out of stasis early once per recovery.</p>
                    <p>If Potato reaches 1 HP after breaking out early and not fully recovering, he will enter recovery without the ability to break out early but will recover at full speed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Channeling</strong>: Potato drapes on an either opponent's or an ally's lap. Neither Potato nor target can move during this ability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ally:</strong> 120 seconds channel. Both Potato and the ally gain <span class="green">+100</span> hp per second recovery <span class="green">+100</span> mp per second recovery. If the entirety of the 120 seconds has been successfully channeled, both Potato and the allied hero gain 1 level's worth of exp.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opponent:</strong> 5 seconds channel. Potato gains <span class="green">+10</span> to accuracy and <span class="green">+30%</span> to damage when attacking the target.</p>

                    <p>Potato flips over and reveals his belly. The opponent has a <span class="green">60%</span> chance of being stunned for 5 seconds while giving Potato a belly rub, a <span class="yellow">20%</span> chance of being unaffected, and a <span class="red">1%</span> chance of making a critical attack on Potato's exposed belly.</p>

                    <p>Potato fakes a belly rub stance. There is a <span class="yellow">50%</span> chance the opponent will be tricked into making an attack, which deals 0 damage as Potato quickly parries and counterattacks.

                    <p><strong>Completion</strong>: If the opponent has less than <span class="red">400</span> HP or less than <span class="red">40%</span> of their max HP, they instantly die. Otherwise, they take <span class="green">100 + 30%</span> of their max HP in direct damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interruption</strong>: If interrupted, the opponent takes prorated damage based on the completed channeling time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Channeling</strong>: 60 seconds. Potato goes into a circle and takes a very safe nap. During the nap, potato is completely stunned, but gains 50% evasion and 90% damage reduction from all sources. Potato may end his nap at any moment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Channeling</strong>: 60 seconds. Potato cuddles up to one ally hero and takes a very loving nap. During the nap, Potato and the allied hero are both completely stunned, but both Potato and the allied hero gain 100 hp per second and 50 mp per second recovery. Either Potato or the allied hero may end this nap at any moment, waking up both heroes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Passive Reaction</strong>: When an opponent's projectile attack or ability misses, Potato can fetch and launch it back at the opponent for <span class="green">2x</span> the original damage. Potato runs at <span class="green">5x</span> his normal move speed to fetch the projectile and returns to his original location at the same speed. This can be animation-canceled for quick map traversal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Opponent</strong>: Movespeed slowed by <span class="red">50%</span>, cannot attack. Can break out by becoming immune to status effects or moving <span class="red">500</span> units away from Potato.</p>

Can break out by becoming immune to status effects or moving <span class="red">500</span> units away.
